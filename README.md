# ASCADv2-Internship

This repository holds the code I wrote for my internship at UCLouvain on SCA against ASCADv2.

It relies on SCALib, a python library developped by Olivier Bronchain.

All the code contained in this repository is mine, except the one in `scripts/utils/multilabelize.py` which I adapted from [https://github.com/ANSSI-FR/ASCAD/blob/58c527fdd82c5c5896d61eeb019cccdd628248eb/ASCAD_generate.py].

I intend to make this repository more reproducible in the future, but for now I haven't written instructions for it.
